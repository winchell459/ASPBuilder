# Clingo: A grounder and solver for logic programs

Clingo is part of the [Potassco](https://potassco.org) project for *Answer Set
Programming* (ASP).  ASP offers a simple and powerful modeling language to
describe combinatorial problems as *logic programs*.  The *clingo* system then
takes such a logic program and computes *answer sets* representing solutions to
the given problem.  To get an idea, check our [Getting
Started](https://potassco.org/doc/start/) page and the [online
version](https://potassco.org/clingo/run/) of clingo.
